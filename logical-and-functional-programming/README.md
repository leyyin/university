# Logical and Functional programming

## Prolog
The prolog environment used is [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/).

To run a prolog file see http://www.swi-prolog.org/FAQ/LoadProgram.html.

Other SWI-Prolog tools and IDE's http://www.swi-prolog.org/IDE.html.

## Lisp (Common Lisp)
See https://common-lisp.net/.

Best editor for lisp is Emacs, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12607716/setting-the-slime-in-emacs, https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/ and https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/.

After you did setup Emacs with slime, open a lisp file:
- execute `M-x slime` to open the slime lisp interaction.
- to compile the current function use `C-c C-c`
- for other commands see the `SLIME` menu above (in Emacs).
