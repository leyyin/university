Transfer files VirtualBox to host OS
------------------------------------
- Share a directory form the host machine and
  mount it on the guest Linux (the one installed
  in VirtualBox). If the host is Windows, look
  into Samba on Linux

- Email ... but how do you do that from the
  command line: mail, mutt, pine

- SCP - secure copy
      - copy files over SSH (which is what you use
        to connect to the server with Putty)
      - how do you ssh to your guest os?
      - 127.0.0.1 - localhost (always assigned to
                    the local machine)
      - use NAT and port forwarding to connect
        Linux guest port 22 to 127.0.0.1 port
        2222 or any other over 1000
      - command line: pscp.exe form the Putty webpage
      - WinSCP

Memory Allocation in C
----------------------
- static
  - ex: int n
        int a[10]
        float f[5][5]
  - THE SIZE OF THE STATICALLY ALLOCATED MEMORY IS
    _KNOW_ AND _SET_ BEFORE COMPILING THE PROGRAM
  - the amount allocated is limited by the stack size
  - does not have to be freed
  - BECAUSE THE SIZE MUST BE KNOW BEFORE COMPILING
    YOU CANNOT USE A VARIABLE TO SET IT. You can
    at most use a macro
  - ex: #define LEN 10
        int a[LEN];

        int n=10;
        int arr[n]; // NOT STATIC but accepted by GCC

- dynamic
  - uses pointers
  - can allocate a lot more than the static version
  - must be freed explicitely
  - malloc, calloc, realloc
  - use "-g" with gcc
  - run your program with valgrind

Windows BAT
-----------
- a BAT script is a file with the .bat extension
- help press F1 on the desktop, and search for
  "Command Reference Overview"
- cd, mkdir, dir, type (like Linux cat), copy, rename
- "rem" is actually the way you add comments to a
  BAT script
