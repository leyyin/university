<h1>What is XPath good for?</h1>
<p>
    XPath, the XML Path Language, is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document. In addition,
    XPath may be used to compute values (e.g., strings, numbers, or Boolean values) from the content of an XML document. XPath was defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
</p>
<p>
    The XPath language is based on a tree representation of the XML document, and provides the ability to navigate around the tree, selecting nodes by a variety of criteria.
    In popular use (though not in the official specification), an XPath expression is often referred to simply as "an XPath".

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
    The XPath for the following XML<br>
    <textarea>
        <A>
            <B>
                <C/>
            </B>
        </A>
    </textarea><br>
    We have the following XPath <pre>/A/B/C</pre>
