# Statement
Solve the following problem using the JSP/Servlet technology. The client-side javascript code should be kept to a minimum, 
possibly none. State information (between web requests) is always stored in a database; you may store some state information 
in cookies/session objects. Write a web application for choosing a transportation route. The database has a list of cities, 
each having a list of neighboring cities. The displays a web page with the current station chosen by the user and all the 
neighboring cities to which this station is connected. The user can then choose a new destination which becomes the new 
current station and so on... At any time the user can specify that the current station is the final destination and in 
this case, the application displays the complete route selected by the user so far. The user should also be able to 
change his/her mind and come back to a previously selected station and change it.
