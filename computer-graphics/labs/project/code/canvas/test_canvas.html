             Rectangles
             (x, y) is the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle

             - fillRect(x, y, width, height) - Draws a filled rectangle.
             - strokeRect(x, y, width, height) - Draws a rectangular outline.
             - clearRect(x, y, width, height) - Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
             - rect(x, y, width, height) Draws a rectangle whose top-left corner is specified by (x, y) with the specified width and height.
             Adds a rectangular path to a currently open path.
             When this method is executed, the moveTo() method is automatically called with the parameters (0,0).
             In other words, the current pen position is automatically reset to the default coordinates.
             */
            /*
             Paths
             - beginPath()
             Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.

             - Path methods
             Methods to set different paths for objects.

             - closePath()
             Closes the path so that future drawing commands are once again directed to the ctx.

             - stroke()
             Draws the shape by stroking its outline.

             - fill()
             Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.

             - moveTo(x, y)
             Moves the pen to the coordinates specified by x and y.
             When the canvas is initialized or beginPath() is called, you typically will want to use the moveTo() function to place the starting point somewhere else

             - lineTo(x, y)
             Draws a line from the current drawing position to the position specified by x and y.
             The starting point is dependent on previously drawn paths,
             where the end point of the previous path is the starting point for the following, etc.
             The starting point can also be changed by using the moveTo() method.

             - arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise)
             Draws an arc which is centered at (x, y) position with radius r starting at startAngle and ending at endAngle going in the given direction by anticlockwise (defaulting to clockwise).
             The startAngle and endAngle parameters define the start and end points of the arc in radians, along the curve of the circle. These are measured from the x axis.

             Angles in the arc function are measured in radians, not degrees. To convert degrees to radians you can use the following JavaScript expression:
             radians = (Math.PI/180)*degrees

             - arcTo(x1, y1, x2, y2, radius)
             Draws an arc with the given control points and radius, connected to the previous point by a straight line.

             - quadraticCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, x, y)
             Draws a quadratic Bézier curve from the current pen position to the end point specified by x and y, using the control point specified by cp1x and cp1y.

             - bezierCurveTo(cp1x, cp1y, cp2x, cp2y, x, y)
             Draws a cubic Bézier curve from the current pen position to the end point specified by x and y, using the control points specified by (cp1x, cp1y) and (cp2x, cp2y).

             A quadratic Bézier curve has a start and an end point and just one control point, while a cubic Bézier curve uses two control points.
             The x and y parameters in both of these methods are the coordinates of the end point.
             cp1x and cp1y are the coordinates of the first control point, and cp2x and cp2y are the coordinates of the second control point.

             # Path2D API
             To simplify the code and to improve performance, the Path2D object, available in recent versions of browsers,
             lets you cache or record these drawing commands. You are able to play back your paths quickly.

             - Path2D()
             The Path2D() constructor returns a newly instantiated Path2D object, optionally with another path as an argument (creates a copy), or optionally with a string consisting of SVG path data.

             - Path2D.addPath(path [, transform])
             Adds a path to the current path with an optional transformation matrix.
             The Path2D API also adds a way to combine paths using the addPath method. This can be useful when you want to built objects from several components

             - All path methods like moveTo, rect, arc or quadraticCurveTo, etc., are available on Path2D objects.

             The Canvas API also provides save() and restore(), for saving and restoring all the canvas ctx’s attributes.
