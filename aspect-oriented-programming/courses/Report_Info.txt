	AOP Report

You have to write a short report (at most 4 pages) about another AOP language (it cannot be AspectJ or Spring AOP).

The report should contain information about join points, pointcuts, advices, introductions, aspects, and weaving for the chosen language.


For maximum mark, you must also present a small working example in that language. Otherwise, the maximum grade will be 9.

You may work in pairs.

Report deadline: last week of the semester (during the course).
